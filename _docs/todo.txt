 * Game mode
    * Rain on water squares only.  That way flood always comes from existing water sources.  This will be more intuitive for players.
 * Simulation mode
    * Rain on all squares to show formation of streams and rivers
       * Do not raise water level while doing this
       * Keep count of the number of times a water line has been used, and make thickness of line proportional to number of rain drops that use path.
