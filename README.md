# Project Description

This project was created for the GovHack 2022 competition.

We have created a fun online game whose objective is to protect a town's houses from damage due to flooding.

We have also created a simulation mode where random mountainous terrain can be generated, and floods can be simulated.


# Game Mode

Our game allows the user to build walls to protect houses from flooding as water levels rise. Our game keeps track of high scores to encourage competition among players and encourage sharing of links to the game on social media etc.

We added a cast of characters to the game who comment on relevant issues such as climate change in an entertaining way. We hope this feature will contribute to the game's popularity, and encourages conversations about the effects of climate change, mitigation strategies, and preparedness.


# Simulation Mode

Our simulation mode allows the user to simulate the effect of rainfall on any point within the map. The path the rain will take as it flows downhill is displayed on the map. By experimenting with this feature, the user can discover how streams and rivers form from rainfall in mountainous regions. The user can also click a button to make the flood recede in steps.

Our game and simulation modes also teach players how to interpret topological maps.

# Data Story

The idea for our game developed as we browsed data sets concerning rainfall and flooding in Tasmania.

We considered using actual topographical data for the terrain in our game, but we decided going down that path would take too long, and would probably result in a less fun game. The purpose of our game is to generate interest and prompt conversations about the effects of climate change, flood risks, and mitigation strategies. We decided that this purpose was better served by having randomised, procedurally generated topographical maps.
