Victoria Challenges
-------------------

 * Better use of data - Connecting addresses in datasets
    * Get lots of data containing addresses
    * Divide addresses into separate fields
    * Attempt to match addresses from one data set with another
    * A perfect match matches exactly on all fields
    * An imperfect match matches on some fields
    * Some fields are more important than others
       - eg if two email addresses match, likely same person,
            if two country fields match, not so likely
